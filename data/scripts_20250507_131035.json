He started honking and flashing his bright headlights, which hurt my eyes. After a third flash, I decided to teach him a lesson. I grabbed my 14,000 lumen flashlight and aimed it out my rear window. I revved my engine to get his attention and then turned on the flashlight. It was so bright that his automatic headlights shut off! I could see him panicking, covering his eyes, and trying to find his sun visor. After about five seconds, I turned it off, and he backed way off and switched lanes. Was it unsafe? Absolutely. Was it warranted? Without question.",

The next day, I showed up in a full suit\u2014completely overdressed for the office. When coworkers asked why I was dressed up, I casually mentioned that I was told to \u201cdress better\u201d by Josh. Their reactions were priceless, and word spread quickly. \n\nLater, the CEO came to my desk and told me I'd be reporting to him from now on, meaning Josh was demoted to just another employee. I\u2019m riding high on this victory and might just wear another flannel tomorrow!",

        "script": "I\u2019ve always been the black sheep of my family, while my cousins became doctors and professors. I made a comfortable living with a part-time job and stable passive income, but my family judged me harshly, especially my cousin Randy, the stereotypical rich bro who always belittled my choices. One day, I spotted him cheating on his wife, and after following him for five hours, I decided to take action. \n\nAt Christmas dinner six months later, I dropped printed photos of Randy with his mistress right in front of everyone, ensuring his wife saw them. Chaos erupted\u2014screaming, fighting, and I ended up with a black eye from Randy\u2019s dad. My family cut me off for years, but Randy faced the consequences: he got divorced and lost custody of his kids after threatening his ex. \n\nNow, I have a good relationship with Randy's ex-wife, and the kids call me \"Uncle.\" I married my SO, and my family tried to reconnect, but seeing me thrive without them seems to eat at them. I\u2019m living my best life now, free from their toxicity.",
