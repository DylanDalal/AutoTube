We\u2019ve been together for three years and married for one. This is a throwaway account just in case. \n\nAbout a week ago my husband and I got into an argument over his phone, which he had misplaced. I was in the shower when he lost it and when I came out he was throwing a fucking fit over it. He was like \u201cwhere did you put it, have you seen it?\u201d Angrily yelling and snapping. \n\nI said I hadn\u2019t touched it and I needed to get dressed. My husband was standing in the doorway looking behind the door so I couldn\u2019t open it. I said \u201chello, move please?\u201d \n\nApparently my tone was rude because my husband turned around and shoved me into the room. I was like okay you need to calm down, I can help you look but I gotta get dressed. He tells me to hurry up. I snap back \u201cI\u2019m not gonna hurry up, it isn\u2019t my fucking fault!\u201d \n\nMy husband turned around and hit me on my mouth with the back of his hand. It didn\u2019t even really hurt but I was appalled. \n\nHe called it a \u201cwarning tap\u201d because of \u201cmy attitude\u201d. I left right then and there. \n\nI called my mom and came over. I haven\u2019t left. My brother took me over the next day to get a few things. My husband asked me if all this really necessary and I said yeah, it is when you abuse your wife. \n\nHe was so stricken that I called it \u201cabuse\u201d. He screamed at me for it. He said I can ruin his career if I use that word. I know that I can and I know that he didn\u2019t even hurt me, but that\u2019s how I feel. He sent me several texts threatening to divorce me if I use that word again, or try to hurt his career by saying it someone \u201cimportant\u201d. AITAH for saying this, potentially citing this, and potentially ruining his career?",
