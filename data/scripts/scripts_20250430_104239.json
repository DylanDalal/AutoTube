        "script": "Earlier this year, I bought six AncestryDNA kits as Christmas gifts for my family. During our Christmas Eve tradition, my mom freaked out when she opened hers, insisting the kits had unsafe chemicals. Despite our explanations, she was flustered and tried to convince us that only one of us should take it, suggesting we resell the extras to save money.\n\nFast forward: Our parents have been fighting upstairs for an hour, while my siblings and I are downstairs wondering if one of us has a different dad.\n\nBut here\u2019s the twist: Christmas turned into a miracle! My sister's biological father passed away shortly after she was born, and a close friend of my mom's helped her through that tough time. They fell in love and created our family, but never told us due to the emotional weight.\n\nLast night, my mom finally shared stories and photos with us, bringing us closer together. This Christmas will forever be unforgettable, and we're all excited to get our test results. Merry Christmas, everyone! \n\nP.S. No, my mom isn\u2019t a whore, and no, you\u2019re not my daddy!"
