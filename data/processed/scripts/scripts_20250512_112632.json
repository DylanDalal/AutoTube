        "script": "Yesterday, at my favorite local supermarket, I was shopping when a sweet 75-year-old lady asked me to help her find aluminum foil. I walked her to aisle 7b, grabbed her a roll, and helped her fill her cart with heavy items. After our chat, I went back to my own shopping. Later, I saw her arguing with the floor manager, Greg, who insisted I didn\u2019t work there. But then, she described me and praised my help. Greg, who knows me, called me \u201cMark,\u201d and suddenly, he thought I was an employee! I lied and said I came in on my day off to help out during a busy time. Greg jokingly offered me the position of Assistant to the Regional Manager, and I couldn\u2019t believe it. The sweet lady chimed in, saying how much she loved shopping there because of the staff\u2019s care. So, I became assistant to the regional manager at a store I don\u2019t even work for!  \nTags: (unbelievable), (twist), (wholesome), (work drama), (heartwarming)",

I asked to move two days for my cousin\u2019s wedding, but she shot back, \u201cSorry, we can\u2019t make exceptions to anyone. It wouldn\u2019t be fair.\u201d \n\nSo, I put in a request for all 23 of my unused PTO days, straight through the end of the quarter. It got approved in just 10 minutes. A couple of days later, she was in full panic mode: \u201cWait, who\u2019s handling your workload?\u201d I replied, \u201cDunno. I assumed you had a plan. No exceptions, right?\u201d\n\nShe had to cover my workload and deal with the fallout. Stuff piled up, clients got angry, and two people quit. When I returned, there was a new HR memo: \u201cManagers can now approve flexible PTO on a case-by-case basis.\u201d Turns out fair looks different when you\u2019re the one getting screwed.\nTags: (work drama), (revenge), (twist), (unbelievable), (justice served)",

I decided to help her, so I pulled out our powered cot to give her a comfortable place to sit. Just as I hit the release tab, a police car showed up\u2014odd since we hadn\u2019t called for help. The woman panicked, bolted into the ambulance, and I realized she was married to the cop. \n\nThe officer, let\u2019s call him Officer Steve, demanded I open the doors to talk to her. I refused, knowing she needed protection. He got aggressive, threatening to charge me with obstruction. So, I stepped aside, but I hadn\u2019t locked the cot in place. When he opened the doors, the heavy cot came crashing out, knocking him down. One deputy laughed while the other advised him to leave before his shift captain arrived. \n\nNow, the woman is safe, but I\u2019ve been pulled over twice a week since then. The best part? The footage of Officer Steve getting bodychecked by my cot will always be a highlight of my career.\nTags: (work drama), (twist), (justice served), (domestic abuse), (police drama)",

I took action: I got a locksmith to access his hoarded house, called the cops, and hired a biohazard company to clean it up. \n\nI documented everything, including the state of the house and Shorty\u2019s thefts. I even got a restraining order against Shorty. In court, I presented my evidence, and the judge granted the order permanently. I made sure my dad\u2019s life insurance would go to my sister and me, not Shorty. \n\nWhen my dad died, I arranged for him to be buried far away, where no one would visit. In August, I learned Shorty was arrested for felony elder abuse and is facing 10 years in prison.
