While I was in the shower, he was fuming, demanding to know where it was. When I came out, he was blocking the door, and after I told him to move, he shoved me into the room. I tried to calm him down, but when I refused to hurry up, he hit me on the mouth with the back of his hand, calling it a \u201cwarning tap\u201d because of my \u201cattitude.\u201d \n\nI was appalled and left to stay with my mom. The next day, when I went back for some things, he was furious that I called it \u201cabuse.\u201d He even threatened to divorce me if I told anyone, saying I could ruin his career. \n\nI know he didn't physically hurt me, but I feel deeply violated. AITAH for saying it was abuse and potentially jeopardizing his career?"
