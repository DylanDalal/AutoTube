        "script": "I was headhunted by a CEO friend to save his struggling tech company. After landing $2M in sales, everything changed when the new VP of Sales, whom I loathed, tried to inflate my numbers to impress an investor. I refused to lie and exposed her deception during a critical pitch. Fast forward, I reported a creepy comment from the CIO about my appearance, thinking it was a minor issue. But when I casually mentioned my lawyer friend, the CEO flipped out, leading to retaliation from my bitchboss. They even canceled my health insurance right before my surgery. After months of harassment, I documented everything and ultimately resigned. My lawyer and I took my case to the EEOC, where we uncovered that bitchboss had forged my write-ups. They offered me $50k to settle, and I accepted. Sweet victory! But my revenge didn\u2019t stop there. For 18 years, I\u2019ve been sabotaging her new marketing company, inundating her employees with spam and chaos. Her firm is in ruins, just like she tried to do to me.",

One day, the teacher stumbled upon a paper-shredding session and discovered that over 60% of the center\u2019s funds were being embezzled. Despite lucrative offers, the teacher refused to join in and was fired just before retirement, losing her package. My sister was furious and knew any report would be ignored, so she devised a plan.\n\nOver the next couple of months, she gathered evidence of the embezzling and crafted an email detailing everything, CCing over 2000 people including the Job Corps national director, Department of Labor officials, every member of Congress, and even the President's office. \n\nTwo weeks later, the investigation wrapped up with only 5 or 6 staff members keeping their jobs, while the rest, including the dean, faced major criminal charges for stealing millions over the years. The teacher received a generous severance package, and my sister was awarded her completion certificate despite not finishing the course\u2014they just wanted her gone!",

I often had to negotiate with Fredo, the kitchen manager, who tried to cut our hours. When I was set up for a meal I didn\u2019t steal, I was fired on the spot. Before leaving, I recorded a conversation that revealed their plot to get rid of me. I quickly found a new job, and during the interview, I played the recording to prove my innocence. Months later, my old restaurant was under investigation after corporate received my video. Harvey was fired after his past of harassment surfaced, and Fredo was arrested for hiring undocumented workers. The fallout included mass layoffs and deportations, all stemming from my wrongful termination. What started as a personal vendetta against me turned into a corporate disaster!",

Five years later, Mom revealed he was in prison for protecting us from Uncle Mark, who liked kids a lot. It turned out Uncle Mark had been abusing his wife and had tried to kidnap me. My dad had beaten him nearly to death when he found out. After my dad was imprisoned, Uncle Mark thought he could get away with it. But my dad found him again, and this time, he took justice into his own hands. He killed Uncle Mark in a fit of rage after discovering more evidence of his crimes. My dad was charged with manslaughter instead of murder, and he said he didn\u2019t regret it. I told him I was proud of him.",

We called the plant company, and thanks to the warranty, they replanted them for free. But just a few nights later, we caught him chopping them down again at 2 AM. We called the police for obstruction of property. After a chat, he decided to get a professional to mark the property line. When I got home, I saw orange tape in his yard\u2014his fence was 11 feet over our line! We watched him take down his fence, fuming. In the end, we got our privacy back, and he lost a quarter of his backyard, costing him almost $10,000 for the destruction. We replanted our plants and enjoyed our new space!",
