I felt uncomfortable but continued to check out. As I walked to my car, he approached me, trying to make small talk\u2014asking my age, why my license plate was from another state, and if I had a boyfriend. I told him I wasn't interested and asked him to leave me alone, but he got even closer. I have a trauma response to being cornered, so I loudly said, \u201cPlease back away from me, I don\u2019t like this.\u201d He laughed and moved in even closer, so I panicked and slammed my palm into his nose, breaking it. He screamed, but I just got into my car and left. Now my friends are divided\u2014some say I\u2019m the asshole for not just walking away, while others say my reaction was justified.
