        "script": "I went to my local grocery store for a couple of items when I noticed a man in his 40s following me closely. He didn\u2019t pick up anything or even have a cart, just trailed behind me as I moved from aisle to aisle. I felt uncomfortable but decided to check out anyway. As I reached my car, he approached me, trying to make awkward small talk about my age and my out-of-state license plate. I told him I wasn\u2019t interested and asked him to leave me alone, but he got even closer.\n\nI have a significant issue with people crowding me due to past trauma, so I shouted, \u201cPlease back away from me, I don\u2019t like this.\u201d He laughed and moved within three inches of me. In that moment of panic, I slammed my palm into his nose, breaking it. He screamed at me while I was having a panic attack, and I just got into my car and drove off.\n\nI shared the story with friends, and opinions are split. Some say I overreacted, while others understand my response given my trauma. So\u2026 AITAH?"
