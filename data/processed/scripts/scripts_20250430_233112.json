        "script": "I went to my local grocery store for a couple of items when I noticed a man in his 40s following me closely. He didn\u2019t pick up anything or even have a cart, just trailed behind me as I moved from aisle to aisle. I felt uncomfortable but decided to check out anyway. As I reached my car, he approached me, trying to make awkward small talk about my age and my out-of-state license plate. I told him I wasn\u2019t interested and asked him to leave me alone, but he got even closer.\n\nI have a significant issue with people crowding me due to past trauma, so I shouted, \u201cPlease back away from me, I don\u2019t like this.\u201d He laughed and moved within three inches of me. In that moment of panic, I slammed my palm into his nose, breaking it. He screamed at me while I was having a panic attack, and I just got into my car and drove off.\n\nI shared the story with friends, and opinions are split. Some say I overreacted, while others understand my response given my trauma. So\u2026 AITAH?"

        "script": "I won the lottery\u2014$1,000 a day for life. At 58, I thought I\u2019d be generous with my 19-year-old son. I offered him the ticket, but I wanted half the money until I die. He needed time to think. When he came back, he argued that it wasn't fair for me to ask for half; I could live another 40 years. He suggested I take just 20% instead.\n\nI signed the ticket and claimed the lump sum, planning to set him up for life with education, a home, and a trust fund. But now he\u2019s furious that I didn\u2019t stick to our original deal. The kicker? He told my ex about the winnings, and now she\u2019s demanding a cut too, even after years of divorce. I owe her nothing, and I\u2019m realizing just how greedy my son really is."

I told him I\u2019d box up his things and return them next time\u2014only if we got our Lego back.\n\nLater that night, he showed up at my house with our Lego, plus a few extra pieces he accidentally took.

I smiled and said her service was fantastic, but since I was a black woman, I don\u2019t tip well. Her face went pale, and she laughed nervously. I walked out, and my boyfriend\u2019s mom was furious, saying I should\u2019ve tipped to show character. My boyfriend and mom are on my side, but now I\u2019m questioning if I should\u2019ve left even a small tip."

When I confronted her, she admitted they\u2019d kissed several times and had been having an emotional affair.\n\nDevastated, I couldn't bear the thought of taking her to the concert after this betrayal. Instead of letting the tickets go to waste, I sold them for $2,400\u2014triple what I paid.\n\nWhen she found out, she lost it. She called me petty and cruel, saying I \"ruined her dream\" and that the tickets were a \"gift\" that belonged to her. Her friends have also been messaging me, calling me an awful person for using the tickets to hurt her.\n\nI feel I had every right to sell them, especially after what she did.

I quickly froze my credit and drove her to the payday loan place, where I paid off the loan in cash, forcing me to dip into my savings for rent. \n\nSo cutting her off worked, but instead of ordering, she was now driving to restaurants with borrowed money, paying exorbitant fees. I told her we would be getting divorced. My marriage is over, and I can only imagine how she'll manage living under a bridge if Uber Eats delivers there."
