I moved to check the wipers, but she followed me, demanding to know why I was ignoring her. I told her the screen was for that, but she insisted I was terrible at customer service. When she threatened to speak to my manager, I decided to call my wife, who I jokingly refer to as my \"manager.\" I put her on speakerphone, and as she realized the situation, she told the woman I didn\u2019t work there. By the end, the lady stormed off, and I left with my wipers, laughing at the whole ridiculous encounter. My wife thinks I was mean, but I say I was just fighting stupidity with a little humor.",
